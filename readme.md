# JavaScript Sandbox

This is the code from my [Modern JS From The Beginning course](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0). It contains all of the learning modules and project code.

## The Starter Files

There is a folder called "javascript-sandbox-start", which contains the starter files for the learning modules and any themes (HTML/CSS) for the projects. You can use these to follow along with the course or create your own files as you go.

## Premium Docs

The premium markdown files with all code samples and explanation are included with the premium course at https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0
